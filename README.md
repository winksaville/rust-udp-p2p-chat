# A udp based peer to peer chat app

Initially written by GPT-4 in answer to the question:

"Write a rust app that uses udp for communication to implement a chat program. Two instances of this app can then be used to send text messages, read as lines of text, from stdin and received text messages are sent to stdout."

This doesn't compile with rustc v1.69.0 but will be my initial
commit to capture exactly what GPT-4 wrote on 2023-05-06.
